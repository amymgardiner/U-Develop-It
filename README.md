# U Develop It

Module 12 Lesson Activity

## About

Throughout this lesson I created database files and tested them in MySQL, and then connected those files to a server using Express.js and testing in Node.js and Insomnia.

This is just the backend of an application for U Vote It, a voting application for a local developer meetup group called U Develop It.
